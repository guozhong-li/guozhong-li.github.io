Hi! I am Guozhong Li, currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and I am very honored to be advised by [Prof. Panos Kalnis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-NdSrrYAAAAJ). 
Prior to that, I was fortunate to complete my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), under the supervision of [Prof. Byron Choi](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~bchoi/) and [Prof. Jianliang Xu](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xujl/). 
I was also a member of the [HKBU Database Group](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~db/).

<!-- Previously, I was a visiting Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Universit√© Paris Cit√©, working with [Prof. Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/home.html) and [Paul Boniol](https://boniolp.github.io) . -->
 
# üîç Research
My research focuses on **efficient and scalable learning**, spanning **modeling, indexing, compression, and reasoning** over dynamic, high-dimensional data, aiming to capture long-range and multimodal dependencies while supporting downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, forecasting, retrieval, and error-bounded compression with both efficiency and effectiveness.
I pursue this goal through advances in **shape-based learning**, **efficient transformers**, **symbolic indexing**, **graph-driven representations**, and **unified frameworks for large-scale temporal reasoning**.

To realize this vision, my work contributes to the following four directions:

- **Efficient Temporal Understanding**  
  Shape-based models and instance profile techniques are developed to enable scalable and explainable time series analysis.

- **Transformer for Temporal Modeling**  
  Variable-position and data-driven attention mechanisms are designed to capture long-range dependencies in multivariate sequences.

- **Retrieval in Large-scale Time Series**  
  Symbolic and neural representations are learned to support efficient similarity search in large-scale temporal datasets.

- **Error-bounded Compression for Scientific/Spatialtemporal Data**  
  Leverage temporal graphs and LLMs to design frameworks that support controllable, error-bounded scientific data compression.
