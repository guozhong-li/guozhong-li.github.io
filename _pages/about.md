Hi! I am Guozhong Li, currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and I am very honored to be advised by [Prof. Panos Kalnis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-NdSrrYAAAAJ). 
Prior to that, I was fortunate to complete my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), under the supervision of [Prof. Byron Choi](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~bchoi/) and [Prof. Jianliang Xu](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xujl/). 
I was also a member of the [HKBU Database Group](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~db/).

<!-- Previously, I was a visiting Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Universit√© Paris Cit√©, working with [Prof. Themis Palpanas](https://helios2.mi.parisdescartes.fr/~themisp/home.html). -->
 
# üîç Research
My research focuses on **spatiotemporal modeling** and **structure-aware representation learning** for time series and spatiotemporal (scientific) data, aiming to capture long-range and multimodal dependencies while supporting downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, forecasting, retrieval, and error-bounded compression with both efficiency and interpretability.
I pursue this goal through advances in **shape-based models**, **attention-based architectures**, **symbolic and graph-based representations**, and **unified frameworks for large-scale temporal reasoning**.

To realize this vision, my work contributes to the following four directions:

- **Interpretable Representations for Temporal Understanding**  
  Shapelet-based models and instance profile techniques are developed to enable scalable and explainable time series analysis.

- **Transformer Architectures for Temporal Modeling**  
  Variable-position and data-driven attention mechanisms are designed to capture long-range dependencies in multivariate sequences.  
  (*[SVP-T: AAAI'23](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26359)*, *[DARKER: PVLDB'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3681954.3681996)*, *[Tisketcher Transformer - Ongoing]*, *[Shape Transformer for TSF - Ongoing]*, *[Multimodal Transformer - Ongoing]*)

- **Learned Index and Retrieval in Large-scale Time Series**  
  Symbolic and neural representations are learned to support efficient similarity search in large-scale temporal datasets.  
  (*[leSAX: ICDE'25](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icde/2025/360300b995/26FZAxpd4ic)*)

- **Graph and LLM-based Compression for Scientific Data**  
  Leverage temporal graphs and LLMs to design frameworks that support controllable, error-bounded scientific data compression.
