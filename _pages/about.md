Hello! I am Guozhong Li, currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and I am very honored to be advised by [Prof. Panos Kalnis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-NdSrrYAAAAJ). 
Prior to thist, I was fortunate to complete my Ph.D. at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), under the supervision of [Prof. Byron Choi](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~bchoi/) and [Prof. Jianliang Xu](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xujl/). 
I was also a member of the [HKBU Database Group](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~db/).
 
# üîç Research
My research focuses on **scalable modeling** and **structure-aware representation learning** for time series and spatial-temporal scientific data, aiming to capture long-range and multimodal dependencies while supporting downstream tasks such as classification, forecasting, retrieval, and error-bounded compression with both efficiency and interpretability.
I pursue this goal through advances in **attention-based architectures**, **symbolic and graph-based representations**, and **unified frameworks for large-scale temporal reasoning**.

To realize this vision, my work contributes to the following four directions:

- **Interpretable Representations for Temporal Understanding**  
  Shapelet-based models and instance profile techniques are developed to enable scalable and explainable time series analysis.   
  (*[ShapeNet: AAAI'21](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17018)*, [Autoshape: ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04313), *[IPS: ICDE'22](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9835498)*, *[BSPCover: TKDE'22](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9096567)* )

- **Transformer Architectures for Temporal Modeling**  
  Variable-position and data-driven attention mechanisms are designed to capture long-range dependencies in multivariate sequences.  
  (*[SVP-T: AAAI'23](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/26359)*, *[DARKER: PVLDB'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3681954.3681996)*)

- **Learned Index and Retrieval in Large-scale Time Series**  
  Symbolic and neural representations are learned to support efficient similarity search in large-scale temporal datasets.  
  (*[leSAX: ICDE'25]*)

- **Graph and LLM-based Compression for Spatial-temporal Scientific Data**  
  Hybrid compression frameworks are constructed using temporal graphs and LLMs to achieve error-bounded compression.
