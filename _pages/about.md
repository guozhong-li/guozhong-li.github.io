Hello! I am Guozhong Li, currently a Postdoctoral research fellow at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Panos Kalnis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-NdSrrYAAAAJ). 
Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), supervised by [Prof. Byron Choi](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~bchoi/) and [Prof. Jianliang Xu](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xujl/), and my MS and BS degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China. 

My research interests include scientific data compression, time series data mining, representation learning, and graph management.
