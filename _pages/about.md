Hello! I am Guozhong Li, currently a Postdoctoral research fellow at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and I am very honored to be advised by [Prof. Panos Kalnis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-NdSrrYAAAAJ). 
Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), supervised by [Prof. Byron Choi](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~bchoi/) and [Prof. Jianliang Xu](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~xujl/), and my MS and BS degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China. 

My research interests are **Temporal Machine Learning** and **Scientific Data Compression**.  
Specifically, my research goals are to develop **Scalable Temporal AI frameworks** (Scalable TAI) and **Structure-aware Compression Systems** (Structured Compression).  
Here, *scalable* refers to modeling long-range dependencies and multimodal signals efficiently across large-scale temporal and scientific datasets.  
*Structured* means that the learned representations are designed to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, retrieval, and error-bounded compression in a resource-efficient and interpretable manner.  
My research helps realize these goals by making progress in the following four directions:

- **Interpretable Time Series Representation**  
  Shapelet-based modeling and instance profiling for scalable and explainable classification  
  (*[AAAI'21: ShapeNet]*, *[ICDE'22: IPS]*, *[TKDE'22: BSPCover]*)

- **Efficient Transformer Architectures for Temporal Data**  
  Variable-position and data-driven attention mechanisms for long-range modeling  
  (*[AAAI'23: SVP-T]*, *[PVLDB'24: DARKER]*)

- **Representation Learning for Indexing and Retrieval**  
  Learned symbolic representations for similarity search and fast retrieval in high-volume time series  
  (*[ICDE'25: leSAX]*)

- **Graph and LLM-based Scientific Data Compression**  
  Error-bounded compression via temporal graphs and hybrid frameworks using LLMs  
  (*[GraphCom - ArXiv]*, *[iGSL - Under Review]*, *[LLM4Comp - Ongoing]*)
